A farmer was present. His sons were four. They argued with each other. As a result, the farmer was concerned about their future. He summoned his sons to him one day. To bring a bundle of sticks, he instructed them. So they acted. Then he instructed each son individually to break the bundle of sticks.

In vain did they attempt. The farmer then instructed them to loosen the knots and break the sticks one at a time. This time, they had no trouble breaking the sticks. The farmer then gave them advice, saying, "If you are united, no one can hurt you. The bundle of sticks couldn't be broken. But once they were split apart, the sticks were simple to break. Therefore, coexist in peace. The sons made a commitment to heed their father's counsel.
